    <h1>Favorite Animal (fixed layout)</h1>
    <p id="intro">Welcome to my Favorite Animal page! In this I will tell you about my personal favorite animal: the frog. I've loved frogs since I was young because I had a frog plushie. Here are some of the cool frogs out there:</p>
    <img alt="Frog blending in" id="blend" src="images/frogblendingin.jpg">
    <p>This frog is doing a great job blending in! It's really impressive how different species of frogs adapt to different environments. In this case, this frog species took on the color of the gray-muddy environment it usually lives in. It might look obvious to us, but most of its predators probably aren't that smart, so it works at warding off predators. </p>
    <img alt="Poisonous frog" id="poison" src="images/poisonfrog.jpg">
    <p>This frog is taking a totally different approach. Since it is poisonous, it has a distinct color to let predators know. That way, no one will want to eat it. Finally, here is some audio of frogs croaking!</p>
