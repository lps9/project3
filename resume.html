    <h1>Resume (fluid layout)</h1>
    <p class="intro">I am currently a high school student, and I haven't had any jobs yet. So instead of jobs, I'll use this resume to talk about some of the activities and classes I've taken.</p>
    <h2>Writing Center</h2>
    <p>I volunteer at my school's writing center, where I help younger students improve their writing and brainstorm ideas.</p>
    <h2>APUSH TA</h2>
    <p>I am a Teaching Assistant for AP US History. I give feedback, help students understand content matter, lead review sessions, and will be creating a lesson to teach by myself.</p>
    <h2>AP Research</h2>
    <p>AP Research is an AP class where you can design a research project. In this class, I'm going to create a study that I will give to classmates to try to find out how a lack of education about AI impacts how people feel about AI.</p>
    <h2>Re-Write It Project</h2>
    <p>I am a secretary at my school's Re-Write It Project chapter, which is an organization dedicated to distributing school supplies. We're going to ask for donations of school supplies and refurbish them. As secretary, my job is to take notes and give updates to members</p>
    <h2>Garden Volunteering</h2>
    <p>I volunteered at my old middle school's garden in 10th grade, helping build new plots, water plants, and spread woodchips, among other things.</p>
    <h2>STEM Event Volunteer</h2>
    <p>I was a volunteer who helped facilitate a stem event for 5th graders, Jones Junior Jam.</p>
