    <p>Hello! I am Laurens! This is my resume website. You can click around on the navbar to see my resume and my favorite animal.</p>
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am a high school student taking ITMD-361 as a dual enrollment course. Programming is one of my hobbies and I enjoy doing it a lot outside of school. I also enjoy spending time with my family, cooking, and learning to play guitar. I can't wait to learn more about web dev!</p>
    <h2>This Site</h2>
    <P>I am creating this site as part of Project 1 of ITMD-361, a class at IIT. Here's IIT's logo!</P>
    <img src="images/iit.jpg" alt="IIT logo">
    <p>So far, I'm enjoying this class! In 2nd semester, I will take data structures and algorithms dual enrollment, which should also be interesting. Project 1 is meant to be no CSS, which is why this website is unstyled even though we've already started learning CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). It also has to have 3 images and 1 other piece of media. I've already used 1 image on this page, but if you want to see the other 2 and my audio media, click on the "Favorite Animal" tab! If you want to see my resume, click on "Resume".</p>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Thanks so much for reading!</p>
